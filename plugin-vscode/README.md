# ACP Client for VS Code

[Français](README.fr.md)

A [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damien-huyet.acp-client) that connects your editor to any [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) coding agent — native CLIs on the host, or isolated Codex/Cursor runs in Docker via Sandcastle.

> [!NOTE]
> Fork of [vscode-acp](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-acp) by [formulahendry](https://github.com/formulahendry), extended with pipelines, agent teams, Sandcastle isolation, and workspace-scoped session history.

## Quick start

1. Install from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damien-huyet.acp-client) | [Open in VS Code](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode%3Aextension%2Fdamien-huyet.acp-client) | [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/damien-huyet/acp-client)
2. Open the **ACP Client** activity bar (ACP icon)
3. In **Agents**, click **+** to add a configuration or pick a default
4. Connect to an agent, then chat in the **Chat** panel

For Sandcastle agents (Codex/Cursor in Docker), complete the [Sandcastle setup](#sandcastle-docker-agents) first.

## Requirements

| Component | Needed for |
|-----------|------------|
| **Node.js 18+** | Spawning native ACP agent processes |
| **ACP-compatible agent** | On `PATH` or via `npx` (see [pre-configured agents](#pre-configured-agents)) |
| **Docker** | Sandcastle-backed Codex and Cursor agents only |
| **Git repo** | Sandcastle git worktrees (Apply/Reject promotion) |

---

## Feature overview

### Chat and sessions

- **Interactive chat** — Markdown rendering, streaming assistant text, collapsible tool calls, thinking blocks with elapsed time
- **Single active agent** — one agent connected at a time; switch agents from the tree
- **Session tree** — expand each agent to browse past sessions; click to open or resume
- **Session capabilities** — uses agent-native `session/list`, `session/load`, and `session/resume` when advertised; falls back to a **workspace-scoped local cache** otherwise
- **Session config options** — dynamic toolbar selectors (mode, model, reasoning level, …) from the agent
- **Slash commands** — autocomplete for agent-provided commands
- **File mentions** — type `@` in the composer to attach workspace file paths
- **Chat persistence** — conversation state survives panel switches; open chat in the sidebar or editor

### Context and editor integration

- **Editor context link** (opt-in) — inject current file, cursor, selection, language, and open editors into prompts
- **Context handoff** — explicitly pass the current discussion to another agent or session (one-shot injection on the next prompt only)
- **Context families** — related sessions are linked in the tree when context is shared
- **File system and terminal** — agents read/write workspace files and run commands through ACP handlers
- **Permissions** — configurable auto-approve (`ask` or `allowAll`)

### Orchestration

- **LangGraph pipelines** — orchestration engine: virtual agents from `.acp/pipelines/*.yaml` (approval gates, custom steps, parallel branches)
- **Agent teams** — declarative shortcut on top of pipelines: `.acp/teams/*.yaml` compiles to pipeline v2 at runtime (`planner` → approval → `implementer` → `reviewer` → optional `tester`)

### Isolation runtimes

Two ways agents interact with your workspace:

| Runtime | Agents | Where it runs | Promotion |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Native ACP** | Claude, Vibe, Codex CLI, … | Host process | Direct workspace writes (default) |
| **Sandcastle** | Codex Sandcastle, Cursor Sandcastle | Docker + git worktree | **Apply** / **Reject** commands |

See [Native ACP vs Sandcastle](#native-acp-vs-sandcastle-docker) for when to use each.

### Developer tooling

- **Protocol traffic** — full ACP JSON-RPC log in the ACP Traffic output channel
- **Debug snapshots** — in-memory trace panel (view, copy, export)
- **Agent registry** — browse discoverable ACP agents
- **Inline chat** (experimental) — editor inset prompt via proposed `editorInsets` API; requires Insiders for full UX

---

## Native ACP vs Sandcastle (Docker)

The chat UI is identical. What changes is **where the agent runs**, **how memory works**, and **how file changes reach your workspace**.

### Comparison

| | **Native ACP** | **Sandcastle** |
|---|----------------|----------------|
| **Transport** | `transport: "acp"` (default) | `transport: "sandcastle"` |
| **Process** | `npx` / local CLI on your machine | Codex or Cursor CLI inside Docker |
| **Filesystem** | Writes to workspace directly | Isolated git worktree until promotion |
| **Conversation memory** | Agent keeps state via `sessionId`; load/resume when supported | Bridge rebuilds a **bounded text transcript** (8 turns, 64 KiB) — [ADR-0014](docs/adr/0014-sandcastle-bounded-prompt-history.md) |
| **Session list / resume** | Yes, when the agent supports it | No native provider resume in Sandcastle 0.6.4 |
| **Best for** | Long threads, resuming past sessions, full provider features | **Fresh runs**, safe spikes, experiments without touching your tree |

Same provider, two modes:

| Settings entry | What you get |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Codex CLI** | Native ACP on the host |
| **Codex Sandcastle** | Codex in Docker with explicit Apply/Reject |
| **Cursor CLI** | Native ACP on the host (`agent acp`) |
| **Cursor Sandcastle** | Cursor in Docker with explicit Apply/Reject |

### Working with fresh agents

A **fresh** agent starts without baggage from earlier turns, tool noise, or half-finished edits.

**Native ACP** sessions are long-lived: the process accumulates context and may resume past sessions. Use **New Conversation** when you want a clean break without Docker.

**Sandcastle** pushes isolation further:

1. **Filesystem** — edits stay in a disposable worktree (`sandcastle/acp/<provider>/<uuid>`) until you promote them.
2. **Provider run** — each prompt is a new `sandbox.run()`; only the last few turns are injected as plain text.
3. **Explicit reset** — **Apply** or **Reject** tears down the sandbox and clears bridge-side history.
4. **New session** — a new ACP session gets a new branch and container context.

| Goal | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Try a risky change safely | Sandcastle → prompt → Show Diff → Apply or Reject |
| Fully reset filesystem + provider context | **Reject** (or Apply if done), then **New Conversation** |
| Compare two implementations | Two Sandcastle sessions, or Reject between attempts |
| Multi-day investigation with full memory | Native agent with session resume |
| Pipeline step must not touch `main` yet | Use a **Sandcastle** agent as implementer in the team |

### Sandcastle workflow (daily use)

1. Connect to **Codex Sandcastle** or **Cursor Sandcastle**
2. Send a focused prompt (one clear goal per run works best — context is capped)
3. Review: **ACP: Sandcastle Show Diff**
4. Promote: **ACP: Sandcastle Apply Changes** or **ACP: Sandcastle Reject Changes**
5. For the next isolated task, start fresh with Reject or **New Conversation**

## Pre-configured agents

### Sandcastle (Docker)

| Agent | Runtime |
|-------|---------|
| Codex Sandcastle | Docker + `codex("gpt-5.4")` |
| Cursor Sandcastle | Docker + `cursor("composer-2")` |

### Native ACP (host)

| Agent | Command |
|-------|---------|
| GitHub Copilot | `npx @github/copilot-language-server@latest --acp` |
| Claude Code | `npx @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest` |
| Gemini CLI | `npx @google/gemini-cli@latest --experimental-acp` |
| Qwen Code | `npx @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest --acp --experimental-skills` |
| Auggie CLI | `npx @augmentcode/auggie@latest --acp` |
| Qoder CLI | `npx @qoder-ai/qodercli@latest --acp` |
| Codex CLI | `npx @zed-industries/codex-acp@latest` |
| Cursor CLI | `agent acp` |
| Vibe | `vibe-acp` |
| OpenCode | `npx opencode-ai@latest acp` |
| OpenClaw | `npx openclaw acp` |
| [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/acp/) | `kiro-cli acp` |
| [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/acp) | `hermes acp` |
| [Pi Agent](https://github.com/svkozak/pi-acp) | `npx -y pi-acp` |

Add custom entries under `acp.agents` in settings. Each entry is either:

```json
{ "command": "npx", "args": ["@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@latest"], "env": {}, "transport": "acp" }
```

or Sandcastle:

```json
{ "transport": "sandcastle", "provider": "codex", "model": "gpt-5.4", "effort": "high", "env": {} }
```

> **Hermes** is a Python package — install via the [Hermes quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) (Linux/macOS/WSL2). Put `hermes` on `PATH` and launch VS Code from the same shell.

> **Vibe** must be installed separately; `vibe-acp` must be on `PATH`.

## Sandcastle (Docker) agents

### One-time setup

```bash
cp .sandcastle/.env.example .sandcastle/.env
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY and CURSOR_API_KEY (gitignored)

docker build \
  --build-arg AGENT_UID="$(id -u)" \
  --build-arg AGENT_GID="$(id -g)" \
  -t acp-client-sandcastle:local \
  -f .sandcastle/Dockerfile .
```

Verify CLIs inside the image:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh acp-client-sandcastle:local \
  -lc 'id && codex --version && cursor-agent --version'
```

### Smoke tests

```bash
npm run sandcastle:smoke:codex    # Apply transfers a sentinel file
npm run sandcastle:smoke:cursor   # Reject keeps main workspace clean
```

### Limits (POC)

- Text prompts only (no images/audio)
- One prompt at a time per session
- Bridge history is volatile (lost on restart or after Apply/Reject)
- Outbound Docker network is unrestricted (API access required)
- Windows not tested for the Sandcastle bridge

## Pipelines and agent teams

Pipelines and agent teams are **not two competing systems**. Teams are a simplified DSL that compiles into the same pipeline v2 engine LangGraph runs.

```text
Agent Teams (.acp/teams/*.yaml)
        │  compile at runtime (AgentTeamCompiler)
        ▼
Pipeline v2 (.acp/pipelines/*.yaml)
        │  LangGraph graph
        ▼
ACP agents (Codex CLI, Vibe, Cursor CLI, …)
```

| | **Pipelines** | **Agent teams** |
|---|---------------|-----------------|
| **Role** | Orchestration engine | Declarative layer on top |
| **When to use** | Custom workflows: parallel branches, non-standard step order, domain-specific primitives | Standard plan → approve → implement → review (and optional test) |
| **Prompts** | Inline in YAML (`primitives.*.prompt`) | External Markdown files (`.acp/agents/*.md`) |
| **Flexibility** | Full DSL v2 | Fixed role order in v1 |

**Keep both features** in the product: pipelines are the engine; teams are ergonomic sugar for the common case.

**Avoid duplicate workspace configs**: if you already have `.acp/teams/feature-team.yaml`, you usually do not need a hand-written `plan-execute-verify` pipeline with the same flow. Use raw pipelines for advanced workflows (see `.acp/pipelines/save/` for examples such as parallel review).

### Pipelines (`.acp/pipelines/*.yaml`)

When `acp.pipeline.enabled` is `true`, each valid pipeline appears as a virtual agent in the tree.

1. Connect to the pipeline agent
2. Send a prompt — LangGraph runs the workflow
3. Review or edit the plan at the approval step
4. Approve to continue, or reject to stop
5. Later steps invoke configured ACP agents (Sandcastle agents isolate workspace-changing steps)

See [docs/pipeline-a2a.md](docs/pipeline-a2a.md) · French: [doc_fr/pipelines-langgraph.md](doc_fr/pipelines-langgraph.md)

### Agent teams (`.acp/teams/*.yaml`)

Declarative plan → implement → review workflows without hand-writing pipeline YAML.

```yaml
version: 1
id: feature-team
title: Feature Team
roles:
  planner:
    agent: Codex CLI
    instructions: .acp/agents/planner.md
  implementer:
    agent: Vibe
    instructions: .acp/agents/implementer.md
  reviewer:
    agent: Claude Code
    instructions: .acp/agents/reviewer.md
```

At runtime, a team like `feature-team` becomes a pipeline with steps `planner → approval → implementer → reviewer` (and `tester` if defined). Inspect the result with **ACP: Show Compiled Team Pipeline**.

See [docs/agent-teams.md](docs/agent-teams.md) · French: [doc_fr/agent-teams.md](doc_fr/agent-teams.md)

## Workspace templates

On first activation, the extension can provision missing workspace files from a bundled starter kit:

- `.acp/` — default pipelines, teams, and agent instruction templates
- `.agents/` — the full skills tree under `.agents/skills/`
- `.sandcastle/` — Docker scaffold only (`Dockerfile`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`)

**Non-destructive:** existing files are never overwritten. Extension upgrades do not modify files you already have (v1).

When `.agents/skills` is seeded and `.cursor/skills` is absent, the extension creates a symlink `.cursor/skills` → `.agents/skills` for Cursor CLI discovery.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `acp.workspaceBootstrap.enabled` | `true` | Enable workspace template provisioning |
| `acp.workspaceBootstrap.autoOnActivation` | `true` | Seed automatically on extension startup |
| `acp.workspaceBootstrap.includePipelineArchive` | `false` | Also copy archived pipelines from `.acp/pipelines/save/` |

Disable auto-provisioning with `acp.workspaceBootstrap.enabled: false`, or run **ACP: Initialize Workspace Templates** (`acp.bootstrapWorkspace`) to re-scan for missing files.

After changing `.acp/` or `.agents/skills/` in the extension repo, run `npm run sync:workspace-starter` before packaging.

---

## Agent Skills

The extension can wire repository skills from `.agents/skills/` for **Cursor CLI**, **Codex Sandcastle**, and **Cursor Sandcastle**.

- **Direct chat** — on the first message of a session, the extension injects an `<available_skills>` catalog (name + description for model-invoked skills). User-invoked skills remain available via `/skill-name`.
- **`/skill` invocation** — a message starting with `/tdd` (for example) is expanded to the full `SKILL.md` content before it is sent to the agent.
- **Cursor CLI** — when `.cursor/skills` is missing, the extension creates a symlink to `.agents/skills` for native CLI discovery.
- **Sandcastle** — the host `.agents/` folder is mounted into the container so Codex/Cursor can see skills even when they are not yet committed in the ephemeral worktree.

Per-agent opt-out: set `"skills": false` on the `acp.agents` entry.

### Architecture

```text
Extension (VS Code)
  ├── SessionManager / ConnectionManager / AgentManager
  ├── Chat webview (React)
  ├── PipelineService + AgentTeamCompiler (LangGraph)
  └── Sandcastle bridge process (stdio ACP → Docker)
        └── @ai-hero/sandcastle → Codex / Cursor CLI
```

Key modules: `src/core/`, `src/ui/`, `src/pipeline/`, `src/sandcastle/`, `webview/`.

Communication with agents uses ACP (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio).

## Known issues

- Agents must be on `PATH` or reachable via `npx`
- Some agents require separate authentication setup
- Pipeline and team roles reference agents by name — all must exist in `acp.agents`
- Sandcastle requires Docker, image build, and `.sandcastle/.env` keys
- Inline chat needs VS Code Insiders + proposed API for the full between-lines UX
- Sandcastle bridge: Windows not tested; macOS/Linux need `AGENT_UID`/`AGENT_GID` at image build time
